** inspo
i really liked [[https://github.com/max-niederman/ttyper][ttyper]], enough that i wanted to extend its functionality a little to suit my needs.
when starting on that, however, it quickly became apparent that it would be easier to design my own from scratch (and learn about ratatui while i'm at it), as ttyper was not easily extensible in the ways i wanted.

so i made this, mashing together my favourite parts from monkeytype and ttyper into one fast tui.

* how 2 use

```bash
$ cargo install arstyper # install
$ arstyper # run
```
